TASK: Generate a Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) context-locked web tool UI + calc engine.

STACK:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- No backend. All computations are client-side.
- Store no personal data; do not use analytics by default.
- Provide deterministic calculation functions suitable for golden-case regression tests.

INPUTS / SPECS AVAILABLE IN REPO:
- /spec/PRD.md (context-locked PRD; must follow)
- /spec/fees_spec.json (authoritative constants + ASC semantics; must follow)
- /spec/golden_cases.json (calculation_contract + expected outputs; must follow)
- /spec/ui_copy_zh_hant.md (must use for all user-facing Chinese copy)
- /spec/ui_wireframe.md (UI structure; must follow)

NON-NEGOTIABLE REQUIREMENTS:
1) NOT a generic calculator. It is Hong Kong HA only.
2) Users MUST NOT input any HK$ fee numbers.
   - All fee amounts and ASC amount are system constants from fees_spec.json (or config.ts derived from it).
3) ASC is HK$10,000, calendar-year, advisory-only, NOT automatic, requires application + review.
   - Must clearly state in UI copy (use ui_copy_zh_hant.md).
4) Each specialty row MUST include:
   - specialty label (text)
   - service type (SOPC/GOPC; default SOPC)
   - follow-up frequency (1/2/3/4/6 months)
   - next follow-up month (1-12) REQUIRED
   - medication tier (none/low/medium/high) REQUIRED
5) Medication is NOT boolean; must use tiers.
6) Output MUST include:
   - average monthly estimate
   - annual total
   - peak month(s) and their totals
   - 12-month distribution grid/table
   - breakdown of visits vs medications per month (at least accessible via expand/collapse)
7) Disclaimers must appear:
   - near top (entry)
   - near results (footer of results)
8) i18n-ready Traditional Chinese labels; keep Hong Kong wording.
9) Ensure determinism:
   - Implement calc engine so it can match golden_cases.json expected outputs exactly.

DELIVERABLES TO GENERATE:
A) /src/config.ts
   - export fee constants for SOPC/GOPC (visit fee, med unit fee)
   - export ASC amount and advisory band thresholds
   - NOTE: constants must be read-only and not user-editable via UI.
B) /src/types.ts
   - TypeScript types for SpecialtyInput, MonthlyBreakdown, CalculationResult, AscAdvisoryLevel.
C) /src/calc.ts
   - Functions:
     - generateVisitScheduleMonths(nextMonth, frequencyMonths) => boolean[12] or month list
     - getMedicationUnitsByTier(tier) => number[12] EXACTLY as contract in golden_cases.json
     - calculateMonthlyTotals(inputs) => { monthlyTotals[12], breakdown.visits[12], breakdown.meds[12] }
     - summarize(monthlyTotals) => { annualTotal, monthlyAverage, peakMonths, peakTotal }
     - getAscAdvisory(annualTotal, ascAmount, bands) => advisory level + ratio
   - Ensure outputs match golden_cases.json expected (including rounding).
D) /src/components/*
   - SpecialtyTable (editable rows; no fee inputs)
   - ResultsPanel (sticky summary optional)
   - MonthlyGrid (12-month display)
   - AscPanel (advisory messages + action links text; no raw URLs required)
E) /src/App.tsx
   - Assemble UI according to ui_wireframe.md.
F) /src/main.tsx + /index.html
   - Standard Vite entry.

TESTING SUPPORT (optional but preferred if time):
- /src/dev/goldenCheck.ts
  - A small dev-only function that loads golden_cases.json (import as json), runs calc, console.logs pass/fail.

UI RULES:
- No input fields for:
  - visit_fee
  - medication_fee
  - asc_amount
  - any threshold numbers
- Show fee amounts as read-only text (sourced from config), e.g.
  - "專科門診診症費：HK$250／次"
  - "專科門診藥費：HK$20／每4星期（系統按月估算）"
- Use ui_copy_zh_hant.md for all public-facing copy.

CALC RULES (MUST FOLLOW golden_cases calculation_contract):
- Use exact medication units patterns by tier:
  - none:  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
  - low:   [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
  - medium:[1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2,1,1,2]
  - high:  [1,2,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,2,1,3]
- Visits: from next_followup_month inclusive, every frequency months within 1..12
- Monthly total = sum(visit fees scheduled in month) + sum(med units * med_unit_fee)
- Annual total = sum(monthly totals)
- Monthly average = annual / 12, rounded to 2 decimals
- Peak months = months where monthly total equals max total (can be multiple)

OUTPUT FORMAT IN UI:
- Month labels: 1月..12月
- Display totals as HK$ integer where applicable; average with 2 decimals.

ACCESSIBILITY:
- Use clear headings.
- Support larger font via browser zoom; avoid fixed pixel fonts.

DO NOT:
- Add region/currency switchers
- Ask users to enter fee numbers
- Claim ASC eligibility or automatic cap application
